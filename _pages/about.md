Welcome to my site! You can [take a look at my resume](/cv) or get to know me through [my projects](/projects). In the late 2010s, I spent my working life making complicated topics accessible to lay readers; today, I help people build better software and navigate technical challenges. Some things I've been a major/sole contributor to include:
* Retrograde, a text-based build-your-own-adventure platformer made for a 72-hour game development competition. [Play it](https://wakeless.studio/demos/retrograde/index.html) or [check out what people had to say](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/41/retrograde/comments)!
* [Anew](anew.harperatkins.org), an app that helps parents-to-be and transgender people choose names using data from the Social Security Administration and some light statistical work (a work in progress!)
* Looking Glass, a horror game for virtual reality in which players must use a hand mirror to peer through the darkness. [It's on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1272530/Looking_Glass/)!

I'm using this space to showcase what I'm learning as a user of AI tools, to collect aesthetic things, and provide people with experiences I hope are useful (or at least fun!).
